Welcome to  ⚔️🧠BrainGuard🧠⚔️

The brain is a complex human body organ that serves as the command center, governing all our thoughts, emotions, and actions. BrainGuard is an image processing project that aims to detect tumors in MRI brain images using machine learning algorithms. This repository contains the code and images necessary to train and test the tumor detection models.

Getting Started with ⚔️🧠BrainGuard🧠⚔️

The project has five folders:
1- image pre-processing
2- CNN model
3- VGG model
4- contrast_stretch_segmentation.zip
5- Threshold.zip

Using Google Colab:

🩻Image Processing Part🩻

Upload:
 1- "Pre_processing.ipynb" code file.
 2- "brain_tumor_dataset.zip" in the files section.

Then, run the cells and enjoy the magic of image processing!✨

⚙️🤖Machine Learning Part🤖⚙️

To run the both models (CNN and VGG-16):
1- upload the model in Google Colab.
2- upload the "contrast_stretch_segmentation.zip" and "Threshold.zip" folders in the files section.
3- run the cells.

Thank you for using ⚔️🧠BrainGuard🧠⚔️!
